# Analysis of Reddit Jokes: Humor Identification, Categorization, and Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Reddit jokes to identify, categorize, and classify humor using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The goal is to understand the underlying patterns in humorous content, classify jokes into categories, and build models to predict humor based on text data. This project is ideal for those interested in NLP, text analysis, and humor research.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Scrapes or uses pre-collected Reddit joke datasets from subreddits like r/Jokes.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses text data using tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
- **Humor Identification**: Implements NLP techniques to identify humorous elements in text.
- **Categorization**: Classifies jokes into categories (e.g., puns, sarcasm, wordplay) using clustering or supervised learning.
- **Classification**: Builds ML models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, or Deep Learning) to predict whether a given text is humorous.
- **Visualization**: Provides insights into joke patterns and categories using visualizations like word clouds and bar charts.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas and NumPy
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (for visualization)
- TensorFlow/PyTorch (optional for deep learning models)
- Reddit API (PRAW) or pre-collected datasets

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/i-tick/Analysis-of-Reddit-Jokes-for-Humor-Identification-Categorization-and-Classification.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to perform joke analysis:
   - Preprocess the data and extract features.
   - Train and evaluate humor classification models.
   - Visualize joke categories and patterns.

## Example Workflow
- **Data Loading**: Load Reddit joke datasets into a Pandas DataFrame.
- **Preprocessing**: Clean and tokenize text data for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Use TF-IDF or word embeddings to convert text into numerical features.
- **Model Training**: Train ML models to classify jokes and evaluate their performance.
- **Visualization**: Generate word clouds and bar charts to explore joke categories and trends.
